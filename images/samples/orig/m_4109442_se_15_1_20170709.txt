    Description:
      Abstract:
        This data set contains imagery from the National Agriculture
        Imagery Program (NAIP).  The NAIP program is administered by
        USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA
        strategic goals centered on agricultural production.
        These are, increase stewardship of America's natural resources
        while enhancing the environment, and to ensure commodities
        are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to
        increase food security.  The NAIP program supports these goals by
        acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected
        during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP
        ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a
        fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation
        programs.  Ortho imagery provides an effective, intuitive
        means of communication about farm program administration
        between FSA and stakeholders.  
        New technology and innovation is identified by fostering and
        maintaining a relationship with vendors and government
        partners, and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial
        community.  As a result of these efforts the NAIP program
        provides three main products: DOQQ tiles,
        Compressed County Mosaics (CCM), and Seamline shape files
        The Contract specifications for NAIP imagery have changed
        over time reflecting agency requirements and improving
        technologies.  These changes include image resolution,
        horizontal accuracy, coverage area, and number of bands.
        In general, flying seasons are established by FSA and are
        targeted for peak crop growing conditions.  The NAIP
        acquisition cycle is based on a minimum 3 year refresh of base
        ortho imagery.  The tiling format of the NAIP imagery is based
        on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer
        on all four sides.  NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM
        coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983.
        NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.
      Purpose:
        NAIP imagery is available for distribution within 60 days
        of the end of a flying season and is intended to provide current
        information of agricultural conditions in support of USDA farm
        programs. For USDA Farm Service Agency, the 1 meter and 1/2 meter
        GSD product provides an ortho image base for Common Land Unit
        boundaries and other data sets.  The 1 meter and 1/2 meter NAIP
        imagery is generally acquired in projects covering full states in
        cooperation with state government and other federal agencies that
        use the imagery for a variety of purposes including land use
        planning and natural resource assessment.  The NAIP is also used 
        for disaster response.  While suitable for a variety of uses,
        prior to 2007 the 2 meter GSD NAIP imagery was primarily intended
        to assess "crop condition and compliance" to USDA farm program
        conditions. The 2 meter imagery was generally acquired only
        for agricultural areas within state projects.

          NAIP horizontal accuracy specifications have evolved over
          the life of the program.  From 2003 to 2004 the
          specifications were as follows: 1-meter GSD imagery was
          to match within 3-meters, and 2-meter GSD to match within 10
          meters of reference imagery.  For 2005 the 1-meter GSD
          specification was changed to 5 meters matching the reference
          imagery.  In 2006 a pilot project was performed using true
          ground specifications rather than reference imagery.  All
          states used the same specifications as 2005 except Utah,
          which required a match of +/- 6 meters to true ground.
          In 2007 all specifications were the same as 2006 except
          Arizona used true ground specifications and all other states
          used reference imagery.  In 2008 and subsequent years
          no 2-meter GSD imagery was acquired and all specifications
          were the same as 2007 except approximately half of the
          states acquired used true ground specifications and the
          other half used reference imagery.  The 2008 states that
          used absolute ground control where; Indiana, Minnesota,
          New Hampshire, North Carolina, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia.
          From 2009 to present all NAIP imagery acquisitions used
          the +/- 6 meters to ground specification.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          Flight planning was performed in Leica MissionPro over a 
          buffered boundary covering DOQQ extents provided by the 
          USDA. A 500m reduced resolution DEM file was used to 
          determine ground heights. A targeted flight altitude of 
          approximately 16,000 feet above ground level for 
          acquisition with sidelap of 27% was used for flight 
          planning parameters. Five Cessna Conquests and a Cessna 
          414 were utilized for acquisition, the seamline 
          shapefile clarifies which aircraft were used for a given 
          area. All aircraft were equipped with Leica ADS100 
          systems for data capture. The Leica ADS100 pushbroom 
          sensor has been calibrated by the manufacturer as well 
          as validated against a local calibration range.  
          The calibration includes measuring the radiometric and 
          geometric properties of the camera.  These data are 
          used in the Post Processing Software 
          to eliminate the radiometric and geometric distortion.     
          All aerial imagery was collected with associated GPS/IMU  
          data.  ADS collection requires high quality IMU data for 
          processing and was critical for early access hosting of 
          digital data to the web for USDA interim access and 
          review. After post processing was complete, all 
          imagery was triangulated using Leica XPro in which 
          the airborne GPS data was constrained to expected limits.  
          To validate the accuracy of the block adjustment derived 
          from GPS/IMU, sensor parameters and conjugate point 
          measurements, photo identifiable ground control points 
          were field surveyed within each State.  These points were 
          surveyed using GPS techniques to produce coordinates 
          that are accurate to +/- 0.25 meters RMSE in XYZ.  
          The GPS surveying techniques utilized assured that the 
          coordinates are derived in the required project datum 
          and relative to an approved 
          National Reference System.  If the block does not fit the 
          control points within specifications the pass and tie 
          points were reviewed for blunders and weak areas.  If, 
          after these corrections were made, the block still 
          does not fit the control well the GPS and IMU processing 
          were reviewed.  Once the block has proper statistics and 
          fits the control to specifications, the final bundle 
          adjustment was made.  As AT points are frequently on 
          man-made and other vertical features not included in 
          the DEM, these ortho points can only be used to 
          indicate regions of error by the clusters of points 
          that predict excessive horizontal displacement.  
          The final adjustments assure a high quality relative 
          adjustment and a high quality absolute adjustment 
          limited to the airborne GPS data accuracy. This process 
          assures the final absolute accuracy of all geopositioned 
          imagery.  Both signalized and photo identified 
          ground control were used to QC and control the IMU/GPS 
          based aerial triangulation bundle block solution. Surdex 
          Grouping Tool provides real-time updates 
          of the USDA APFO Image Metrics.  The image technician 
          adjusts image correction parameters to bring the 
          radiometric characteristics of large groups of images 
          within the Image Metrics ranges. For each 
          project area the highest resolution DEM or LiDAR was
          obtained and utilized for rectification of captured 
          imagery. A visual inspection of the final DEM using 
          color cycled classification by elevation and a shaded 
          relief was performed to check for gaps, corruption 
          and gross errors.  The predicted horizontal error for 
          each point was added as an attribute in the SURDEX 
          enterprise database.  An operator reviews ortho seams 
          in areas these predicted errors indicate horizontal 
          error in excess of the contract specifications.  
          Any imagery errors introduced by source DEM required 
          patching from an alternate perspective or strip of 
          photography.  Processing hardware used included various 
          brands of survey grade GPS receivers, various brands 
          and models of computers, calibrated monitors and 
          various brands of monitor calibration colorimeters. 
          Leica XPro was used for post 
          processing of ADS pushbroom data, triangulation and 
          orthorectification.  SURDEX software was used to color 
          correct and remove bidirectional reflectance, 
          vignetting and other illumination trends.  
          USDA APFO Image Metrics are measured and 
          images corrected to conform to the Image Metrics using 
          SURDEX software.  GPS/IMU data was reduced to projected 
          coordinates in the appropriate UTM zone using 
          Inertial Explorer software from Novatel. Aerial 
          Triangulation and orthorectification was performed 
          using Leica XPro. SURDEX software was used to 
          adjust for minor radiometric variation between adjacent 
          images.  SURDEX software was used to calculate the 
          optimal seam path, check seam topology and 
          create master tiles.  SURDEX ortho software generates 
          occlusion/smear polygons used during seam review 
          of steep terrain.  SURDEX software was used to 
          visually inspect master tiles for seam and image 
          defects.  SURDEX software was used to project and 
          cut final DOQQ image files from masters.  
          SURDEX software was used to create CCM 
          metadata.  Lizardtech GeoExpress version 9.1.0.3981 
          was used to create the CCM image file.  SURDEX software 
          was used to perform final formatting, QC and naming 
          of the DOQQ. USGS metadata parser software was used 
          to validate the metadata. 
          Various versions of Microsoft Windows were used in all 
          phases of production. Grouping Tool was used again 
          after DOQQ and CCM production to provide a 
          quality assurance check. Individual DOQQ and CCM may 
          not meet the USDA APFO Image Metrics ranges 
          due to land cover.  The goal is to have the state as a 
          whole meet the Image Metrics. All products are reviewed 
          by independent personnel prior to delivery.
